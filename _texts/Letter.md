## Letter One - Gladys Chu, 23 July 76

23 July 76
David dear

    CONGRATULATIONS!!!

    Thank you for calling to tell me - you deserved the Honors in Chinese and History - you know that.  I'm glad and relieved that you are all settled (for the coming year at least) and that you are happy and satisfied and hopeful. No more problems, right? Let's make it a good year.
Forgive me for my stubborn fears and demands. I have been trying to blot out my feelings about you in order to let other thoughts  (non-emotional, rational, objective thoughts) have a chance to get through. I guess that's why I have been so confusing & contradictory. But my feelings about you are still strong - despite what you may think, I miss being with you, talking with you, sharing... In the month of August, 1841, I attended an anti-slavery convention in Nantucket, at which it was my happiness to become acquainted with *Frederick Douglass*, the writer of the following Narrative. He was a stranger to nearly every member of that body; but, having recently made his escape from the southern prison-house of bondage, and feeling his curiosity excited to ascertain the principles and measures of the abolitionists,—of whom he had heard a somewhat vague description while he was a slave,—he was induced to give his attendance, on the occasion alluded to, though at that time a resident in New Bedford.


> - Gone, gone, sold and gone
> - To the rice swamp dank and lone,
> - Where the slave-whip ceaseless swings,
> - Where the noisome insect stings,
> - Where the fever-demon strews
> - Poison with the falling dews,
> - Where the sickly sunbeams glare
> - Through the hot and misty air: 
> - Gone, gone, sold and gone
> - To the rice swamp dank and lone,
> - From Virginia hills and waters—
> - Woe is me, my stolen daughters!

<sup id="fn1">*</sup> This is the same man who gave me the roots to prevent my being whipped by Mr. Covey. He was "a clever soul." We used frequently to talk about the fight with Covey, and as often as we did so, he would claim my success as the result of the roots which he gave me. This superstition is very common among the more ignorant slaves. A slave seldom dies but that his death is attributed to trickery. [&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;](#ref1)

<sup id="fn3">*</sup> I had changed my name from Frederick Bailey to that of Johnson. [&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;](#ref3)

<sup id="fn4">*</sup> I am told that colored persons can now get employment at calking in New Bedford—a result of anti-slavery effort. [&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;](#ref4)
